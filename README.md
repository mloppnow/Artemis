# Artemis

Artemis is interactive community that bridges the gap between the virtual world and real technology, people, and wanderlust.

Artemis: Goddesses of the Hunt inspires movement, investigation, and face-to-face social
interaction with our user-centric scavenger hunt Pursuits. She provides tech-curious young
women with a challenging, fun and accessible way to explore new technology, support
small business, and inspire a generation of women innovators within their hometown.

Artemis was built on Android Studio, using Google API's for maps, location services, and vision. 

Developed for the SheInnovates Hackathon @ Pitt 2019.
